### Entropy-based Methods in Quantification of Multimodal Transportation Systems Diversity
- Use Python (Numpy and Pandas packages) to apply entropy-based methods in quantifying multimodal transportation systems diversity
- Apply Python (Matplotlib package) to visualize zip-code level multimodal transportation systems diversity and zip-code level census characteristics
