### Entropy-based Diversity Quantification of Multimodal Transportation Systems
- Develop physical infrastructure diversity metrics based on open-source GIS database through ArcGIS software; develop travel behavior diversity metrics based on Connecticut travel survey dataset through Excel.
- Perform the entropy method to quantify multimodal transportation systems diversity through Python Numpy and Pandas packages.
- Visualize zip-code level diversity and US census data through ArcGIS, Minitab, and Python Matplotlib package.
